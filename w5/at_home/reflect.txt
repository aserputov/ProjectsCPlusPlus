Hello, Michael in this lab we suppose to learn code a compositional relationship across multiple classes, manage dynamic memory within a class, overload an operator as a member of a class overload an operator as a helper function of a class. I want to divide my new knowledge of this lab into two parts. Allocating & deallocating memory and additional information. In the DIY part of this lab, I finally strengthen my knowledge about allocating and deallocating memory by using new and delete instruments. I find allocating memory for an array the harder than just simple char variables. And I spend a lot of time to clear near 300 bytes from my memory. Another(2 part ) is learning knowledge about operators and overloading operators. I find what it was two types like friendly and non-friendly operators. And important was two find the way to use array from another class. It was the first time when we had to work with 4 files and two classes in different files. At the same time, I repeat a lot of material about "This" and member functions connections.
