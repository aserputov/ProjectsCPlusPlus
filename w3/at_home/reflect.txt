Hello, Dear professor, in this lab of "Classes and Privacy" I spend a lot of time understanding new topics of classes. At first, I find how public and private functions working. I start understanding what means member functions and I feel good then start understanding how to get access to private variables from another class. For example: in the DIY part I create extra member functions in class because just this way I can find access and after I send them to another class. In the lab, part lab assistant explained to me why we need to include the prefix (function name::)in our functions. And we work with modifiers' functions. We work a lot with scope parts. I understand what member function will local to the struct or class. Actually, I find hard and important for me to learn more about deallocating and allocating "playdoh" to our program. And repeat some information of modules and cout/cin parts.
