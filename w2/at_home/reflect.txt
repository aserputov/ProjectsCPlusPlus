In this lab I found a lot of practical work after terminology on lectures. If have functions same names but different parameters we can call this overloading functions and how pointers different from & references, but the most important and hard part was allocating dynamic memory and deallocating memory. I found it's important and useful for future programs. Labs helps us to practice our knowledges;
How does dynamic memory differ from static memory?
Static memory is memory which u give for program before  debugging and dynamic you give if for example memory depends on choices of user. 
2. What errors if any did you encounter when incorporating dynamic memory?
Spend much time with writing functions to allocate and deallocate memory.
3. For the overloaded functions used in this workshop, how did they differ? 
void gifting is function overloading, using one name but different parameters.
